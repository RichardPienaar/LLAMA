/** 
 *  This script is a wrapper around generateSaveTracks
 *  The non-parameterised version (get_tracks.groovy) is identical except that the parameters are hard-coded and there is no 
 *  docString. That version is intended to be copied, edited and run for a particular case, then saved with the output as
 *  a log / documentation.
 *  
 *  In brief, the tracking algorithm matches objects of the same class over time, while selectively merging adjacent objects 
 *  in an integrated process. Information used is object position and volume and adjacency between objects (and of course time and class).
 *  Other object information is passed through, with appropriate handling when objects are merged.
 *  
 *  INPUT SPECIFICATION
 *  The input data for this tracking algorithm consists of 2 text files for each time step:  
 *    objectStats.txt
 *    	- contains summary information for each object
 *    	- formatted as a tab-separated table where each row represents one object 
 *    	- must have columns titled id, class, x, y, z, and voxels, with numerical values
 *    	- x,y,z describe the centre of mass of each object in voxel units
 *    	- id, class, voxels are expected to be integers, but if not will be rounded to the nearest integer
 *    	- id must be unique for each line, but does not need to be consistent across time steps (since that is the point of the tracking)
 *    objectAdjacencyTable.txt 
 *    	- describes contact between objects of all classes
 *    	- comma-separated table with 3 columns and no header (so every line consists of 3 numbers separated by commas)
 *    	- The first 2 numbers are object ids corresponding to values in objectStats.txt; order doesn't matter and each pair occurs at most once 
 *    	- The third number quantifies the contact between the 2 objects (the exact means of quantification doesn't matter, 
 *    			but may affect the optimal selection of the parameter relativeNodeContact_referenceValue)
 *  objectStats may contain additional columns listed below, but these do not influence the tracking. Instead, these are properties that are 
 *  	transferred to the output tracks for the purpose of further analysis. Objects may be merged as part of the tracking process, and in 
 *  	this case values are combined as appropriate (mean values are weighted by object sizes etc). The meanings given are intended only, since 
 *  	this process has no control over the data supplied and its derivation; however, they will affect how information is combined when 
 *  	merging objects
 *  	- intensity, channelMean, classProbs[class] represent the mean strength of signal in the source image, the mean channel/class value 
 *  		(for use when the original classes have been aggregated for object analysis), and the mean probability of each class according
 *  		to the segmentation model. 
 *  	- d[class], dv[class], dMin[class] and dMax[class], where [class] is the integer label of a class, are intended to represent the 
 *  		mean, variance, minimum and maximum distance of the object from the specified class.
 *  	- vx,vy,vz,cxy,cxz,cyx describe the covariance matric of the voxel positions (gives information on shape, compactness, orientation) 
 *  	
 * OUTPUT DETAILS
 * 
 * The output is a table of track "nodes" which are formed from 1 or more of the objects (from the same time and class) in the input data. 
 * This table is saved as a tab-seperated table trackNodeTable.csv, with each row corresponding to a node.
 * The node id is unique over the table (all classes) and is not the same as the object id.
 * The field objectIds list the original object id or ids (needs to be matched to the correct time step, since object ids are not unique over time). 
 * The field timeStep is derived from the filename or alphanumerical rank of the folder containg the object information (details below). 
 * The field trackId groups nodes over time into tracks; the fields linkedPrev, linkedNext, distPrev, distNext give additional track information
 * The fields adjacentNodes, adjacentNodeContact, adjacentTracks are based on the object adjacency data, converted to node and track ids and 
 * with appropriate handling of merging.
 * The field branchOrEnd is used to flag special nodes in tracking versions that allowed branched tracks, but is left FALSE here since all tracks are simple
 * (and start/end nodes are easily found).
 * 
 * 
 * These fields are passed through from the object data (track node fields and corresponding object data fields). Merges are handled appropriately, units are unchanged.
 * 		x	y	z	voxels	signalIntensity	channelMean	classProb0 (etc)	distMean1	distVar1	distMin1	distMax1 (etc)
 * 		x	y	z	voxels	intensity		channel		prob0 (etc)			d1			dv1			dMin1		dMax1 (etc)	
 * 
 * These fields are also passed through from the object data, but with units changed from voxels to the real units defined by the 
 * parameter fieldScaling (track node fields and corresponding object data fields)

 *  
 * PARAMETERS
 * @param String main_path
 * Path to a directory containing the main input data, which is assumed to be derived from a single capture 
 * (although break points can be specified if imaging was discontinuous).
 * This directory must contain sub-directories which each contain the summary object information for one image stack, consisting of
 * the files objectStats.txt and objectAdjacencyTable.txt as described above. 
 * The stack number (assumed to be a sequential timestep) should be included in each subdirectory name between 2 fixed text strings 
 * (the number may be padded with 0s on the left). Alternatively, each stack can be assigned a stack number based on its alphanumerical
 * rank within the main_path directory, starting from zero.
 * @param String save_path: A fully specified path (folder and filename) under which to save the output file, may be 
 * within the folder main_path
 * @param int[] timeSteps_specified
 * Allows tracking to be restricted to the subset of time steps listed. If null or length 0, all time steps are used. 
 * Time steps will always be sorted into numerical order.
 * @param int[] breakPoints
 * Allows tracking to be broken up into distinct intervals. For each listed integer, tracks will be terminated at the
 * corresponding time step and restarted at the following step. If null, no breaks are applied.
 * @param boolean useAlphabeticalPositionForStackNumber
 * If true, subdirectories within main_path will be assigned a stack number based on alphanumerical rank, starting at zero. 
 * Otherwise, stack number is extracted using stackNumPrefix and stackNumSuffix below.
 * @param String stackNumPrefix
 * A text string preceeding the stack number in each subdirectory name (used if useAlphabeticalPositionForStackNumber false)
 * @param String stackNumSuffix
 * A text string following the stack number in each subdirectory name (used if useAlphabeticalPositionForStackNumber false)
 * @param double[] fieldScaling
 * The x,y,z size of a voxel. Used to convert object position into "real" units, most importantly an isotropic scale for 
 * correct matching behaviour. Units need to be consistent with the tracking parameters listed below. 
 * @param boolean verbose
 * For debugging from the ImageJ script window; if true, extensive additional information is written to the console.
 * @param int[] trackedClasses
 * The integer labels of the classes to be tracked. Each class is tracked independantly.
 * 
 * THE REMAINING PARAMETERS ARE ALL ARRAYS OF THE SAME LENGTH AS trackedClasses, REPRESENTING PARAMETERS SPECIFIED PER-CLASS
 * 
 * @param voxelThresholds
 * Objects with fewer voxels will be immediately discarded. This should be set conservatively, as small objects may be merged 
 * into larger ones and missing pieces may reduce the quality of tracks produced. This step is designed to filter out very 
 * small objects to reduce computational cost. It is recommended that a more stringent filter is applied later, 
 * requiring each track to reach a threshold before being used in analysis. 
 * @param logSizeWeight
 * When finding the distance between objects for the pupose of matching, the difference in log volume is 
 * used alongside spatial distance. This is the weighting factor to apply to the difference in log volume 
 * (equivalently, log of volume ratio). This weighted difference is then squared and added to the square of the spatial distance. 
 * The square root of this sum is the distance metric used in matching objects.
 * @param matchThreshold
 * The maximum matching distance allowed (with distance as defined above).
 * @param relativeNodeContact_referenceValue
 * scaling parameter controlling the influence of contact between objects on whether they should be merged.
 * Higher values reduce the likelihood of merging.
 * @param relativeNodeDistance_referenceValue
 * scaling parameter controlling the influence of proximity between objects (relative to size) on whether 
 * they should be merged. Positive number. Higher values reduce the likelihood of merging.
 * @param relativeNodeContact_weight
 * Number between 0 and 1 indating the weight that should be placed on contact vs centre of mass proximity when deciding 
 * whether objects should be merged.
 * @param matchScoreWeighting
 * The weight to place on matching distance between time steps versus object merging metrics when deciding on optimal tracks.
